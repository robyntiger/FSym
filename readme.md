# FSym
FSym, short for Face Symbols (because I hate the word 'emoticon' xD), is a work in progress stack-based esolang. Created solely for the purpose of seeing if I can create my own language... :p


## Current commands
(More will be added as I develop them)
Command | Description
------------ | -------------
:) | Pops top item from the stack and returns the value
:@ | Pops top two items from the stack, adds them together, then pushes the result to the stack
;) | Prints every item in the stack
